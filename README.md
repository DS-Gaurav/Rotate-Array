# Rotate-Array

Given an unsorted array arr[] of size N. Rotate the array to the left (counter-clockwise direction) by D steps, where D is a positive integer. 


 Your Task:
You need not print or read anything. You need to complete the function rotateArr() which takes the array, D and N as input parameters and rotates the array by D elements. The array must be modified in-place without using extra space.
